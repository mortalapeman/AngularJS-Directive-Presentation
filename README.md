# AngularJS Presentation

If you are just interested in the slides, open the `presentation/index.html` file.

If you want to run the express server to server the html, css, and javascript, install nodejs
and run `node app.js` from the top level repo directory. You can then switch between branches
and visit `localhost:3000` to see the different directive/scope examples I used in the presentation.
